Accessibility Analysis and Improvements



Contrast and Readability: Some text did not have enough contrast against the background, reducing visibility.
Semantic Markup: Non-semantic HTML elements were used in some sections, impacting screen reader usability.
Responsive Design: Layouts did not adjust properly on smaller screens.
Visual Hierarchy: Headings and content did not follow a consistent structure.


Types of Changes Made
To address these problems the text contrast and font styles were improved for better readability. Semantic elements like main and header were added to improve screen reader accessibility. Media queries were added to make sure the layout adapts properly to different screen sizes, and heading levels were corrected to make a clear and consistent hierarchy.

Gestalt Principles

Figure/Ground: Improved contrast makes it easier to distinguish content from the background.
Proximity: Adjusting spacing clarified relationships between grouped elements, like table rows and card content.
Similarity: Consistent styles for headings, buttons, and cards enhance visual unity across the site.
